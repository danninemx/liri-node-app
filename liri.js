// code to read and set any environment variables with the dotenv package:
require("dotenv").config();

// code required to import the keys.js file and store it in a variable.
var keys = require("./keys.js");

// access your keys information like so:
var spotify = new Spotify(keys.spotify);


/*
Make it so liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

   * `concert-this`

   * `spotify-this-song`

   * `movie-this`

   * `do-what-it-says`

### BONUS

* In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called `log.txt`.
* Make sure you append each command you run to the `log.txt` file.
* Do not overwrite your file each time you run a command.
